# Data Warehouse - Music Streaming Platform

This project aims to develop an open music-streaming platform where independent artists and aspiring musicians can upload their music to gain visibility and recognition
from listeners and industry professionals alike. The platform will serve as a bridge between artists and music producers, talent scouts, and record labels by offering a 
robust database and discovery system. The primary focus is to create a fair, transparent, and efficient ecosystem for showcasing talent and fostering meaningful connections
within the music industry.

The goal is to create a centralized and structured repository of music-related data that enables efficient analytics and fosters meaningful connections between artists 
and industry stakeholders. A critical component of this project is the ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process, which will be implemented using Talend, an open-source data 
integration tool. The ETL pipeline will extract raw data from multiple sources, including the streaming platform’s databases, user activity logs, and engagement analytics. 
This data will then be transformed into a structured and standardized format through processes such as data cleaning, duplicate removal, and aggregation of streaming and 
engagement metrics. Finally, the transformed data will be loaded into a PostgreSQL-based data warehouse

By ensuring transparency in performance metrics, it will allow artists to track their music’s reach and audience engagement more effectively. Producers and talent scouts 
will benefit from an enhanced discovery system that enables them to explore emerging artists based on structured and insightful data
